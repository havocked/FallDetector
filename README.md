# Fall Logger

## Description

- "Fall Logger" App is monitoring the device falls, save them locally in json file and show an alert.
- The app uses a trained Model (cf: FallActivityClassifier) with CoreML to determine if the phone activity is falling or not.
- You can access the CreatML project at the root of the project folder (cf. "MachineLearning/FallActivityClassifier.mlproj").
- If a new model is generated with the name "FallActivityClassifier", it will replace automatically the previous one used by the app.

## Requirements
- iOS Deployement Target: 15.3
- XCode Version: 13.3
